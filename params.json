It uses `memcached` to store and retrieve frequently-queried data.\r\n\r\nTo get started (after installing the above dependencies), you should do the following:\r\n\r\n1. `git clone` Animurecs\r\n2. Modify `global/config.php.example` to work with your setup and rename it to `global/config.php`\r\n3. Modify `dbv/config.php.sample` with the authentication setup of your choice and rename it to `dbv/config.php`\r\n4. Open up `dbv/index.php` in your browser and push all the disk schema to your database\r\n\r\nAfter that, you'll want to write a rewrite rule for your webserver so you can have pretty URLs. For nginx, it'd look something like this (inside your server block):\r\n\r\n    if (!-e $request_filename) {\r\n        rewrite  ^/([a-zA-Z0-9\\_]+)?(/(.+?))?(/([0-9A-Za-z\\_]+))?/?(\\.([a-zA-Z]+))?/?$ /index.php?model=$1&id=$3&action=$5&format=$7 last;\r\n        break;\r\n    }\r\n\r\nYou should be all set up to go after that!\r\n\r\n&copy; 2012 Charles Guo",
