title: Beta, quick update
---

Just a quick update - we've pushed the site out to a larger group of people, and I've gotten a ton of helpful feedback as a result. Dismissing recommendations has been put on the back burner for now; as it turns out, there's a fair number of quirks with the recommendation that need to be addressed. For instance, the engine seems to rank some strange series abnormally high - Karneval and Tenchi in Tokyo stand out as examples - so we're getting a bunch of people with very similar recommended lists. I'll look into what's causing this, and how future recommendations can be made more-personal.

Also, lots of users commented that having to wait up to half an hour for their recommendations to generate wasn't fast enough -- and I totally agree! I've been doing my reading on SVDs, and I think I have a pretty good idea how I'm going to implement single-user feature updates in real-time. I just need to sit down for an evening and devote myself to it.

As these changes get pushed out, I'm considering putting Animurecs into closed-beta status; a lot of the edges are still pretty rough, so I don't want people leaving Animurecs with a bad taste in their mouths before it's even gotten off the ground. So if you're on the fence about whether or not you should sign up, it'd be a good idea to do so soon!
