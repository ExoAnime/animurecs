Animurecs
=========

Animurecs is a PHP / MySQL social network aimed at making enjoying anime a communal experience. It uses `memcached` to store and retrieve frequently-queried data.

To get started (after installing the above dependencies), you should be able to simply `git clone` Animurecs, modify `global/config.php.example` to work with your setup, rename it to `global/config.php`, and then import the database schema at `sql/animurecs.sql.gz`.
